# don

Simple Mastodon CLI for creating posts. Built with Deno.

Usage:

```console
don post "Hello from don!"
```

When you run `don` for the first time, it will prompt you to set up an
application on your instance to get an access token to make requests with.

## Bugs / Features

- Only allows you to post to Mastodon and nothing else
- Text-only
